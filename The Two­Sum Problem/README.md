#The Two-Sum Problem

This is a classic algorithmic interview question. There are many different solution routes, each of which involves a different technique.

Problem Statement:

You are given an array of n integers and a number k. Determine whether there is a pairof elements in the array that sums to exactly k. For example, given the array [1, 3, 7] andk = 8, the answer is “yes,” but given k = 6 the answer is “no.”
